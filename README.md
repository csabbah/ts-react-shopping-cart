This tool allows users to easily add and update items in their cart, making it simple to keep track of their purchases. If a user adds the same product more than once, the quantity will be updated automatically. And if the quantity is reduced below 1, the item will be removed from the cart. Hosted on Vercel, ts-react-shopping-cart is reliable and efficient, providing a seamless shopping experience for users.
